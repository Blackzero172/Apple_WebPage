# Apple_WebPage

First order of business was getting all my assets that being fonts and images into my local computer and then i started to divide the website into different elements and the diagram i came up with is like this
<br>
/////Header-Nav/////
<br>
/////Sale/////
<br>
/////Section-1/////
<br>
/////Section-2/////
<br>
/////Section-3/////
<br>
/Section-4///Section-5
<br>
/Section-6///Section-7
<br>
/Section-8///Section-9
<br>
/////Footer-Nav/////
<br>
/////Copyright/////
<br>

/////Header-Nav/////
<br>
and so i started figuring out all the parameters of the website using the dev tools and some trial and error until i finally got the neccesary numbers to start working
first thing i did was test if the fonts i downloaded were the correct weight after that i started make a baseline navbar using an unordered list then i added the transparent background after that i aquired the svgs that i need and placed them inside when i had all my elements ready i started styling the navbar that being adding the display flex property and adjust margining and padding to match my target and with that the navbar was done (1.5hrs)

/////Sale/////
<br>
secondly i made the holiday sale bar which didn't take that long i just added a text,aligned it in the center and boom done (25mins)

/////Section-1/////
<br>
up next was our holiday sale hero section,now this part was a bit tricky at first but when i figured out the correct sizing and margining it went smoothly (45mins)

/////Section-2/////
<br>
now was the time to make the second hero section which is about the iphone 13 pro now this part was pretty straight forward added in the background,combined the links and the text into a div and added margin top and it was done (25mins)

/////Section-3/////
<br>
i was done with this section pretty quickly because i already had 90% work done in the previous section so i just copy pasted the previous one,changed the text color and background image (10mins)

/////Section-4/////
<br>
now this section i had to do the same work i did in section 2 that being align everything one time and then copy and paste that result to the remaining sections (35mins)

/////Section-5-9/////
<br>
these sections had the same workflow,get the logo svg add it in and go onto the next and this was possible because apple's website has a standard margin of 2.7rem and this fact helped me out alot because i didnt have to figure out the values each time i added in a new section (50mins)

/////Footer-Nav/////
<br>
now we get to the tedious part,this section was not hard to organize but rather was hard to fill due to the excessive amount of links and sections and so organizing it took about 25mins but filling it will all the a tags and then filling all the a tags with the proper links took about 45mins (1.1hrs)

/////Copyright/////
<br>
and last but not least the copyright section now this was a bit confusing at first due to the way that apple divided this section but when i saw that their way was complicating simple things i ditched it and went with my own apporach (35mins)

Overall: 6.4hrs taken

i really wanted to try and copy another website after i learned flexbox and grid because i wanted to see the difference when i was using the best tools out there vs the old tools and boy did i see,the last time i tried this project it took me over 16 hrs and it wasn't 100 1:1 while this time it took less than 8 hrs and i finished it 1:1 + 8 question of JS which is kinda nice.
